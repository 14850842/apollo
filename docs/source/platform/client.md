<h2 id="developer-tools">Developer tooling</h2>

In addition to libraries you put in your client, there are some great tools you can use to integrate with your development environment and editor:

* [GraphQL ESLint Plugin](https://github.com/apollographql/eslint-plugin-graphql): This is a plugin you can add to ESLint to validate your GraphQL queries and see errors show up right inside your editor. 
* [Apollo Codegen](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-codegen): You can use this tool to generate static types for your queries, for TypeScript, Flow, Java, Scala, or Swift. 
* Apollo Client Devtools: This is a Chrome dev tools panel you can use to run GraphQL queries against your server, see what queries and mutations are active in your page, and inspect the current state of the store.
