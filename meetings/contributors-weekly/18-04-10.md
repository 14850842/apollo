### Notes

**apollo-client**

- documentation around how to create a new cache
- cache filtering
- cache persist
- extensions field inform maxAge

**apollo-cache**

- improvements to the performance by ben
- selectively filtering
- question of what gets persisted in the cache
- change the data blob that saved to disk
- more control over the extract function
- might play into eviction policy
- evict before you extract

**apollo-server**

- api changes with 2.0
- where to process errors?
- if this fails was it an upstream
- categorize:
  - forming query wrong
  - server not implemented
  - resource fails

- ssr fails the request
- filter, some kay 404's
- have a top level heurisitic
- have rest calls that are made by a resolver
- autogenerated -> captures the rest calls as debugging information
- rest to graphql -> proxy the 400 to the top
- want the application 500 or 400 matters
- level of delegation want to do
- no idea what happens ->
- optional, opinionated thing
- mixing fragements -> some don't care

**apollo-cache**

- new function: `updateQuery` for cache
- resolvers easier

**client-side schemas**

- client side schemas
- apollo-codegen to build typescript types
- have a client graphql file
- It would be great to have schema passed in
  - okay for React Native
- cache persist could use this schema to validate

**eslint-plugin-graphql**

- would like to have code reviewers

**graphql-tools**

- okay to move away from 0.11?
