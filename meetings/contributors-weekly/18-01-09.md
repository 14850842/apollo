### Agenda

- React-Apollo planned changes
- Feedback on components work by Dirk & Kevin
- Concerns around typing & PR from Leo

### Notes

**James: Planned work on React-Apollo 2.1 API**
- working on changes to Apollo Client
- roadmap for reference: https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/blob/master/ROADMAP.md
- want next version to be 100% backwards compatible (not a 3.0 design)
- important work is around query component design

**Dirk: Work on components work he and Kevin Ross would like feedback on**
- 3 types: 
  - query
  - description
  - mutation
- would like to get more feedback on use cases, esp. once the implementation is in npm
- current work:
  - updating dependencies and test cleanup
  - need to automate deployment process
  - kevin working on example for typescript
- issue: flow types are very hard to keep up-to-date (updates tend to break things)
  - possible solution is to move into flowtype repo (ask dirk/james for more detail)
  - sashko: might make sense to make compromises to automate this
- peggy: would love for us to transition to using 3 explicit render props (as opposed to child)
  - render-loading, render-error, render-data
  - more detail on this direction in original roadmap
  - sashko: what counts as loading needs to be explicit (e.g. re-fetch)
  - issue: getting recompose to work with render prop
- subscriptions component implementation
- kevin: issues with re-fetch in higher order components
- follow up: Peggy to add various related PRs to central design document and add link here once updated 

**Documentation**
- need for more documentation of testing 
- more "Practical GraphQL" content needed (best practices, common design patterns/implementations)
  - James planning on more of this kind of content
  
**Leo: would like to work on making react-apollo and apollo-codegen more strictly typed**
- PR to reference: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-codegen/issues/308
- concern: related to types in react-apollo; some of the code is not entirely typed or strictly using typescript/ type checking, willing to contribute to fixing this
- James: was related to release schedule, contributions are definitely welcome
- codegen: would like to see type checking in javascript api as weâ€™re doing in swift
- follow up: meeting with James, Martijn and Leo on types

### Other meetings going on:
- martijn / lewis - flow targets
- james / peggy / martijn - client-side tooling
