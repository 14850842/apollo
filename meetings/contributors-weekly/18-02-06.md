### Agenda

**React-apollo**

- Discuss progress v2.1 of `react-apollo` w.r.t. `Mutation` and `Subscription` component and their current status.
- Discuss the tasks that that still need to be done for the v2.1 release of `react-apollo` and how we can best keep track of progress.
- Thoughts on supporting the new react context API in v2.1.
- Thoughts on creating a monorepo (as mentioned in [roadmap](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/blob/master/ROADMAP.md) or merging react-apollo with the existing apollo-client monorepo (which will simplify coordination across modules).

**Opportunities to Collaborate**

- apollo-link-mock: accepts a schema and returns values for every field in your query
- apollo-link-sw-cache: caches get requests with a service worker
- apollo-link documentation: the link specific docs don't currently do a good job of describing capabilities
- brainstorm how to make these meetings more accessible
